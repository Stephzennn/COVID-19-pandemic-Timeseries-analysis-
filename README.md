We plan to conduct a comprehensive time series forecasting studying using COVID-19 pandemic data to evaluate model performance through retrospective analysis. Our primary research focus involves using Covid-19 health metrics such as daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths to forecast epidemic wave patterns and comparing these predictions against actual outcomes at various time point throughout the pandemic. Additionally, we will examine the relationship between health indicators and economic recovery by incorporating FRED economic data such unemployment claims, and GDP to forecast economic recovery patterns based on health trends. This dual approach allow us to systematically evaluate how well different machine learning models capture both epidemiological dynamics and cross-domain health-to-economic relationships.
